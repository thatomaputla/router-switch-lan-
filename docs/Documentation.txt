TITLE SECTION
Project title: Inter-Departmental LAN Connectivity using router and switches
Author: Thato Maputla
Date: 24 February 2026

OVERVIEW
This project shows a network between 2 departments in a company using the network address (192.168.40.0). All the end-user devices are configured with appropriate IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways. The departments each consist of 3 end-user devices connected through dedicated switches and a central router. This design ensures that devices within and across departments can communicate seamlessly.



OBJECTIVES
1. Implement subnetting to create 2 departmental subnets from a single network ID
2. Configure switches to communicate within the departments.
3. Configure router to enable communication across the network.
4. Verify connectivity between all devices through simulation tools.



NETWORK TOPOLOGY (Extended star)
Devices used:	1 Router (central interconnection point)
		1 Laptop (for one department)
		2 Switches (one per department)
		2 Printers (one per department)
		3 PCs (2 in one department, 1 in another)
		
Logical design: Each department is connected to its own switch. The switches are connected to the router, which routes traffic between the two subnets.

SUBNETTING 
Provided network: 192.168.40.0
Number of subnets required: 2

//formula for calculating subnets:
//2^n = 2
//solving for n we get: n = 1
//given n = 1; this will represent borrowed bits
//11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
//255.255.255.128 = Subnet mask with block size of 128

First Subnet:
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.128
Network ID = 192.168.40.0
CIDR notation = 192.168.40.0/25
Valid host range = 192.168.40.1 -> 192.168.40.126
Broadcast ID = 192.168.40.127

Second Subnet:
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.128
Network ID = 192.168.40.128
CIDR notation = 192.168.40.128/25
Valid host range = 192.168.40.129 -> 192.168.40.254
Broadcast ID = 192.168.40.255



IP ADDRESSING SCHEME
1. HR Department (192.168.40.128/25)
- PC 0: IP address=192.168.40.130 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128 ; Default gateway=192.168.40.129 
- Laptop0: IP address=192.168.40.131 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128 ; Default gateway=192.168.40.129
- Printer0: IP address=192.168.40.132 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128 ; Default gateway=192.168.40.129
- Router Interface gig0/1: IP address=192.168.40.129 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128

2. Tech Support (192.168.40.0/25)
- PC 1: IP address=192.168.40.2 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128 ; Default gateway=192.168.40.1 
- PC 2: IP address=192.168.40.3 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128 ; Default gateway=192.168.40.1
- Printer1: IP address=192.168.40.4 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128 ; Default gateway=192.168.40.1
- Router Interface gig0/0: IP address=192.168.40.1 ; Subnet mask=255.255.255.128



CONFIGURATION STEPS (sanitized)
1. Router:	Router> en
		Router# config t
		Router(config)# int range gig0/0-1
		Router(config-if-range)# no shutdown
		Router(config-if)# do wr
		Router(config-if)# exit
		Router(config)# int gig0/0
		Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.128
		Router(config-if)# int gig0/1
		Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.129 255.255.255.128
		Router(config-if)# do wr
		Router(config-if)# exit

2. Switches: Default configuration sufficient for this project

3. End devices: Manually assigned Ip address, subnet masks, and gateway.



TESTING & VERIFICATION 
Ping tests: 	PC0 -> Laptop0 (same subnet)
		PC0 -> Printer1 (different subnet, routed via router)
		Laptop0 -> PC1 (cross-department communication)
Results: All tests were successful showing evidence of communication across departments.



CONCLUSION 
This project demonstrated the fundamentals of LAN design and inter-departmental communication using Cisco Packet Tracer. Key skills practiced; subnetting & IP addressing, CIDR notation application, router configuration, OSI Model application, switch setup, and connectivity testing. The design can be scaled further by adding more departments, VLANs, or advanced routing protocols.
